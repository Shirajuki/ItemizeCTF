Challenges with a folder named `<cat>/chall>/files` are files that were presented to the players to download during the CTF.

## Writeups:
All challenges should contain either a `writeup.md` or a folder called `writeup` which has a description of how you could have solved the challenges.

## docker:
Most challenges that were running services, e.g. web servers or pwn applications have a `docker-compose.yml` file which you can start by running `docker-compose up` to start the service localy for testing.
